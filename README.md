## Test application

#### <b>Requirement</b>: We want to develop an application that automatically plays music and displays an image on the screen. The project has been given a code structure, and now we would like you to help us develop the following action.

#### Particularly:
1. Implement a function to get initials text from the name in the JSON data.
2. Implement a function to play music from the given URL.
3. Show image and display initials text on views.
4. Implement button click events to play the previous/next one.

Bonus: Write a unit test for the get initials function (optional).

#### Notice:
* BASE_URL: The host contains API and media sources.
* Project is running on Java_17. If you are using Java_1_8, please config it in the build.gradle (app).
* MVVM and Coroutines are used in the project. But you can choose another approach that you are the most friendly with.
* Please find and follow the TODO section in Android Studio to finish the assignment.

Give it your best shot.<br>
Wishing you success in the test.
