## Test application

#### <b>Requirement</b>: We want to develop an application that automatically plays music and displays an image on the screen. The project has been given a code structure, and now we would like you to help us develop the following action.

#### Particularly:
1. Implement a function to get initials text from the name in the JSON data.
2. Implement a function to play music from the given URL.
3. Show image and display initials text on views.
4. Implement button click events to play the previous/next one.
5. BONUS - Write a unit test for the get initials function (optional).

#### Notice:
* ```BASE_URL```: The host contains API and media sources.
* Project is running on ```Java_17```. If you are using ```Java_1_8```, please config it in the build.gradle (app).
* ```MVVM``` and ```Coroutines``` are used. But you can choose another approach that you are the most friendly with.
* Please find and follow the ```TODO``` section in Android Studio to finish the assignment.

Wishing you success in the test.
